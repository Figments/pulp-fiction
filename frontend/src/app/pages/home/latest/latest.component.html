                Hey there!
            </p>
            <p>
                Say hello to Offprint&mdash;a website built from the ground up to foster an engaging, 
                friendly, and open community of writers and readers. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The site is currently under heavy active development, so there's a lot of stuff still 
                missing or even completely broken.
            </p>
