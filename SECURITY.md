# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We only support the latest versions of Dragonfish with security patches. 
Luckily, it's easy to keep track of that as the current state of `main` 
will always be the most up-to-date version of Dragonfish. Please always
use the latest commit to `main`.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability, please send me an email describing it
and how to reproduce it at figments@offprint.net.

Thank you.
